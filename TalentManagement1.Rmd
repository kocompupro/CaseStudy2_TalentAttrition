# Introduction 
This R markdown document will be providing analysis of Talent Management. This process is to leverage our data analysis by creating a linear model and then use stepwise model to pick the idea model. After StepWise identifies some key attributes. We will drill down into Tableau to conduct a more meanful analysis. 

##Libraries that are needed for this process.
```{r ,INCLUDE=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(sqldf)
library(caTools)
library(MASS)
library(caret)
library(leaps)
library(QuantPsyc)
library(GGally)
```
